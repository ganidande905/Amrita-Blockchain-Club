1st reason would defiently be the term "meta verse" im so pulled to that concept after watching many hollywood movies..always wanted to explore that domain
and hoping this club will help on that as meta verse is a domain which none of the other clubs have
2nd reason would be this is a new club...so i think growing along and with the new club is a beneficial thing for both me and the club
3rd reason would be....block chain...ive always wondered what block chain was...i tried studying it...wanted to invest in crypto but didnt have much knowledge
im pretty sure this club elaborates on block chain
coming to the 4th reason...actually the intresting thing is that i instantly got intrested towards this club is because of the tasks....the way they combined coding with block chain in the second problem...i just love their idea
so yea thats to it
